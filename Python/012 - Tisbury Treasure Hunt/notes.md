# Tisbury Treasure Hunt

Focus:
- Tuples

<br>

Comments:
- The tuple() function only takes in one argument
- Tuples can be combined into one using the + operator
- If there is an item that needs to be removed from a tuple, it can be converted into a list since tuples are immutable
- If there is a need to access a nested tuple, can use double square brackets to access it, e.g. tuple[1][1]

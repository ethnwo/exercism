Focus:
- Dictionaries
- A litte bit of tuples

Comments:
- When using for loops with dictionaries, using the .item() method will return both the key and value for iteration.
- Dictionary.update() can combine two dictionaries, or a dictionary with an iterable. If there are identical keys, the value will follow the value of the key dictionary/iterable in the parentheses.

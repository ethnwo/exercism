# Inventory Management

Focus:
- Dictionaries
- A little bit of tuples

<br>

Comments:
- The tuple() function only takes in one argument - add multiple elements to a list so it becomes a single argument
- Can use "for key, value in dictionary" for loops on dictionaries to access each value specifically if required
